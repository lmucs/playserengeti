    <dt>What is Serengeti?</dt>
    <dd>Serengeti is a social networking application/game that allows for players to join teams and claim territory by recording visits to real world locations. </dd>
    <dt>How do I join a team?</dt>
    <dd>To join a team, you must be invited to the team by the team leader indicated on the team's profile page. Team invites you receive are displayed on your profile page, where you can accept or deny them.</dd>
    <dt>Once I join a team, how do I check in?</dt>
    <dd>Checking in can be done in a snap. On your profile page, select your location and the team you'd like to check in for from the drop down menus, then click the "Check In" button.</dd>
    <dt>Wait a minute, I can't see my location in the drop down menu.</dt>
    <dd>If your current location is not in the drop down menu, click the "Not Here?" button. Enter the name of the location in the search box that appears, and then choose the location from the new drop down menu. You can now finish your check in at your new location.</dd>
    <dt>Can I check in by text messaging or mobile applications?</dt>
    <dd>Serengeti does not currently support check in by text messaging. However, an iPhone/iPod Touch is currently in development.</dd>
