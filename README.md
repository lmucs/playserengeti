# Serengeti

Serengeti is a location-aware social networking application in which users join teams and check-in 
from multiple (real) locations to effectively conquer territory.  Players can engage in friendly 
competitions, organize events to raise money for charity, or simply find out where their friends 
or enemies might be.

Serengeti was developed as a course project at Loyola Marymount University from September-December, 2009.  
The traditional [http://code.google.com/p/playserengeti/wiki/Main_Page project notebook] is on the course wiki.
