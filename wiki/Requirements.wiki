The following questions are regarding the technical requirements.  Above are the user interaction requirements (i.e. how it should function for the user, not how it accomplishes the tasks).  Technical requirements are to be specified below.

Questions from Kelly
These are questions that shall be answered by the requirements.
  # How often can a user "check in"?
  # What is the minimum amount of information required to create a user? What is the optional information associated   with a user account?
  # How does a person become the "owner" of a venue?
  # How does a team become the "owner" of a venue?
  # What formats will your server spit out (XML, JSON, YAML)? What will be the first format you implement?
  # Will there be any limiting to the number of requests a client can make?
  # Who can add a new venue?
  # Who can change data about a venue?
  # What will the database schema look like? (This is a design question.)
  # What happens when the server receives a bad request?
