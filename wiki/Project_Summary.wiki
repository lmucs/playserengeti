=== Short Description ===

Serengeti is a social networking application and game where players join teams that compete for "ownership" of locations (businesses, parks, beaches, and so on) by recording their visits to these locations. Visits are recorded by "checking in" via a mobile browser or iPhone app. Players can track their teams' conquests through the playserengeti website. 

=== Narrative ===

Serengeti is a location-aware, social networking application and game where participants join teams, record visits to real world locations (beaches, parks, business establishments), and assist their team in "taking ownership" of locations. Users can be part of multiple teams, but their visits can only be attributed to one team of the user's choice at a time. To record visits, users _check in_ at their location, either by a web application accessible to mobile devices or a specially developed application for major mobile platforms, such as the iPhone. Points for a location and team are given for each visit, and the team with the highest point total for a location is considered the "owner" of the location.

Teams can get a more in-depth look at their teams' standings on the `playserengeti` website. Team statistics can be viewed along with a Google Maps interface pointing out the locations a team currently owns.

Locations can offer benefits to their current "owner" team, such as a discount, if they wish to do so.  Teams can also set up small competitions between themselves, offering a prize to a team based upon a set of rules specified at the creation of the competition.  Competitions can even be organized to support charitable organizations.  Serengeti can even be used just to find out where your friends might be.
