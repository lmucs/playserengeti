==Business/Location==
----

Question: is a business different than a location? How do we define each? [[User:Gratrixl|Gratrixl]] 22:39, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

Answer(somewhat)/Expanding on Question: They should probably be considered different entities.  That way, we can include things like a local park or monument that will not actually have business deals but still be a place to control.  Or we could just keep them the same and never allow those locations to have deals/offers.--[[User:Cmueller|Cmueller]] 00:00, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

My vote is to separate them. Let locations be user-submitted content, but businesses by validated somehow. [[User:Gratrixl|Gratrixl]] 06:16, 9 September 2009 (UTC)
