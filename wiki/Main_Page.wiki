This is the official wiki for the CMSI 401 Software Engineering Laboratory course for 2009.  

The wiki also functions as the traditional project notebook.  All design notes, documents, reports, discussion, and other artifacts related to the course are kept here.  The content has been thoughtfully organized and indexed; guests can browse the project artifacts in the order they appear in the table of contents to the left.

For information about the course for which this project was written, including the syllabus and the course notes, see the  [http://www.cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/se LMU course web page].  This wiki is strictly for the coursework and collaboration, not for dissemination of course announcements and requirements.
