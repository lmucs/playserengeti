## Serengeti ##

Serengeti is a location-aware social networking application in which users join teams and check-in from multiple (real) locations to effectively conquer territory.  Players can engage in friendly competitions, organize events to raise money for charity, or simply find out where their friends or enemies might be.

Serengeti was developed as a course project at Loyola Marymount University from September-December, 2009.  The traditional [project notebook](http://code.google.com/p/playserengeti/wiki/Main_Page) is on the course wiki.

The students' final presentation is publicly available in [ODP format](http://playserengeti.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/serengeti/src/site/serengeti.odp).
